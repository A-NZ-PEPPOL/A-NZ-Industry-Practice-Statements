# A-NZ-Industry-Practice-Statements
This repository contains Industry Practice Statements, and guidance and recommendation documents that aim to support Peppol implementation and enhance interoperability in Australia and New Zealand.

It includes:
* Industry Practice Statements (IPS) for Invoice Content and Invoice Response (i.e., Communicating Invoice Status), which were co-developed by the respective A-NZ industry working groups. 
* Guidance, best practice or recommendation documents developed by the A-NZ Peppol All Stakeholders Working Group (ASWG), which is co-chaired by Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand (DSPANZ) and the A-NZ Peppol Authorities. Focus groups are formed under the ASWG to address specific topics or issues, with the outcomes documented here, and also published by [DSPANZ](https://www.dspanz.org/committees/peppol/anz-peppol-all-stakeholders-working-group/).

## What's inside
The following documents have been created to address emerging business and/or technical issues.
* Communicating Invoice Status: This document provides guidance for Peppol Service Providers to support their clients in communicating invoice status via the Peppol network. It covers business level response (i.e., Invoice Response Message).
* Invoice Content: This document provides guidance for suppliers and their Peppol Service Providers for managing additional data requirements, to meet the needs of their buyers.  It provides guidance on common data requirements of large buyers to support streamlined and automated invoice processing.
* Consistent Data Mapping: This document provides guidance on consistent interpretation and implementation of the A-NZ invoice specification. It promotes the mapping of data according to its semantic meaning, to ensure interoperability and realisation of network efficiency.
